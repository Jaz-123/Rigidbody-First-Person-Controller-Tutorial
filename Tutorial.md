# Rigidbody First Person Controller Tutorial

This tutorial shows how to create an easily expandable first person rigidbody controller in Unity.

## 1. Create a new scene

Start by creating a new empty scene calling it whatever you like.

Create a new empty game object and name it `Player`.

To this game object, add a rigidbody and set the `Collision Detection` to `Continuous`, set `Interpolate` to `Interpolate`.

Under the `Player` game object, create a 3D capsule to act as the player object.
